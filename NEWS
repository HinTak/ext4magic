ext4magic 0.1.3 	there is now a german documentation 
			http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikide/index.php/BerliosProject:Ext4magic

			We start with the BETA testing and try to find some german users for the
			tests of general use, the elementary functions and the documentation.
			The aim is to check the stability and to optimize the german documentation
			for a translation.
