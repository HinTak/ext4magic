ext4magic 0.2.1         Optional Expert-Mode with the following new options "-s blocksize" ; "-n blockcount" ; "-c"
			This makes it possible to open front corrupted file systems.

			Modified flow control allows automatic a recover-all ("-r" or "-R" on the entire file system) 
			This enables the restore of deleted inode even if the directory inode is not found in journal.
			The function uses the first two stages of the magic functions (ext3/ext4)

			Support for most files types of a typical Linux system and lots of multimedia files.

			Many bugs have been fixed and added support for many file types



ext4magic 0.2.0 pv0	First test version of ext3 magic-scan-functions. This is a novel multi-stage recovery.
			There are several recover methods used in succession. All functions use journal entries.
			Furthermore, the library libmagic and coded file properties are implemented.
			This automatic functions are specifically designed to recover deleted files immediate 
			after a recursiv delete command.

			http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikide/index.php/BerliosProject:Ext4magic

			tests of general use, the elementary functions and the documentation.
			The aim is to check the stability and to optimize the german documentation
			for a translation.
