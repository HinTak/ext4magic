ext4magic 0.1.4		Support for user-modifiable file attributes.
			ext4magic can now restore the ext2/3/4 File attributes.
			It is disabled by default. To activate, you must add the option --enable-file-attr
			when running configure.



ext4magic 0.1.3 	there is now a german documentation 
			http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikide/index.php/BerliosProject:Ext4magic

			We start with the BETA testing and try to find some german users for the
			tests of general use, the elementary functions and the documentation.
			The aim is to check the stability and to optimize the german documentation
			for a translation.
