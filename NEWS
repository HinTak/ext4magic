ext4magic 0.2.0 pv0	First test version of ext3 magic-scan-functions. This is a novel multi-stage recovery.
			There are several recover methods used in succession. All functions use journal entries.
			Furthermore, the library libmagic and coded file properties are implemented.
			This automatic functions are specifically designed to recover deleted files immediate 
			after a recursiv delete command.
 
			For this purpose two new options are available.
			"-M"  if the entire file system is deleted
			"-m"  if only parts of the file system is deleted



ext4magic 0.1.4		Support for user-modifiable file attributes.
			ext4magic can now restore the ext2/3/4 File attributes.
			It is disabled by default. To activate, you must add the option --enable-file-attr
			when running configure.



ext4magic 0.1.3 	there is now a german documentation 
			http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikide/index.php/BerliosProject:Ext4magic

			We start with the BETA testing and try to find some german users for the
			tests of general use, the elementary functions and the documentation.
			The aim is to check the stability and to optimize the german documentation
			for a translation.
