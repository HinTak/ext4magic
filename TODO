TODO over of the next year ;-)

- English documentation
	we working on it, but we need help !!!!!!!
	http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:Ext4magic

	
- support for ecrypfs in the Magic-function
	is particularly interesting for Ubuntu user


- the new Magic-function for ext3
	old 0.2.x function is very slow and inaccurate
	and is not compatible with the Magic-functions of the ext4 in 0.3.x
	a support for both file systems is planned with 0.4.x


- better support for source code and other text files
	"file" can not detect the text file type if a long comment at begin of the file
	therefore the Magic-function recovers not all
	
	shell example : for a possibility solution approach
	# file -i ext4magic.c
	ext4magic.c: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

	# sed '1,/^$/d' ext4magic.c | file -i -
	/dev/stdin: text/x-c; charset=us-ascii


- ext4 : with the Magic-function it should be possible to recover also some file types
  if the deleted file has existed with 2 to 4 extents
	the conditions and preparations are already included
	the possible individual extents are already collected in the database
	a function is needed to find out and check the correct order



Currently known issues
- on big-endian the crtime and deleted directory entry not correct if use the
  real libfunction for read the inode.
  The modified version to read the Journal inode works. BUG:#017304 ; #017304
